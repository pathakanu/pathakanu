## 👨‍💻 About Me  
I’m a software engineer with professional experience in **automation testing**, **backend systems**, and **blockchain development**.  
I love solving real-world problems through clean, scalable code — whether it’s building decentralized apps, LLM evaluation frameworks, or API backends.

My journey began in **corporate QA automation**, where I worked extensively on test frameworks, API validation, and regression automation using **Playwright**, **WebDriverIO**, **Selenium**, and **CI/CD pipelines**.  
That background taught me to engineer for reliability and performance — skills I now apply in backend and blockchain development.
